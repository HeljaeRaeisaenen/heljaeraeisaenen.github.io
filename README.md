# Detecting clickbait 

## What are clickbaits?

Clickbaits are news articles which encourage the users to click on them, often by using exaggerated headlines, and giving promises of content they are not specifying in the headline. A classic clickbait could say, for example, “You wouldn’t believe how amazing this new method is!”. This headline tries to catch the attention of the reader by promising something new and amazing, even saying you wouldn’t believe how good it is. The headline, however, does not elaborate on what method we are talking about, or why does it work. The user needs to click the headline and read the article to see those details. 

Many people consider clickbaits to be an issue, in part because the content of the article often does not match the exaggerated headline and leaves the reader disappointed. In addition, clickbait articles are often considered to be talking about irrelevant things, not actual news that the user would need to read. 

Maybe some more elaboration on why clickbait is a problem?
